# Scraper

## Description

Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the process of retrieving or “scraping” data from a website. Unlike the mundane, mind-numbing process of manually extracting data, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.

This project shows an example of web scraping by extracting the names and prices of shoes from the famous NIKE website and presenting it to the user.
